It looks like the callback is meant to be a page on your web server that 
the smsgateway.me requests to inform you that there is a message. 

You want a php script on your webserver that might contain something like 
the following code: 

<?php 

$mysecret = '<your api callback secret>'; 

if ($_POST['secret'] == $mysecret) { 

  switch($_POST['event']) { 

    case 'Received': 
      // an sms was received 
      // process received message 
      break; 

    case 'Sent': 
      // an sms was sent 
      break; 

    case 'Update': 
      // there was an update 
      break; 

    default: 
      // this should never happen 
      error_log('bad api callback event received in smscallback.php', 0); 
  } 

} 
else { 
  // record in your log that the secret was wrong 
  error_log('bad api callback secret received in smscallback.php', 0); 
} 

Then you log in to your account at smsgateway.me, you go to the events 
page, you set up a callback event for received messages, you use the http 
method, you set the secret to <your api callback secret> and you set the 
http url to http://your-web-server-address/path/to/smscallback.php 

This will inly work if the smsgateway.me server can connect to 

http://your-web-server-address/path/to/smscallback.php 

If you are working from home with dynamic ip on adsl you will have all 
sorts of network configuration issues to resolve, none of which are 
relevant to the php newsgroup.
